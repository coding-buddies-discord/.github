# Welcome to Coding Buddies

We're friends from all over the world, that have one thing in commmon. We all really enjoy coding. 

Coding Buddies above all else is a **community**. A community dedicated to helping people transistion into technology careers and thrive once in them. This is done through providing: 
- comradery
- mentorship 
- resources
- opporunities to work on low-impact collabrative projects regardless of current skill-level
